          <h2 class="discover-h1">Demographic</h2>
          <p class="discover-p">Sacramento, California's vibrant and diverse capital city, boasts a fascinating demographic landscape that reflects the ongoing evolution of the region. With a population of over half a million residents, Sacramento is marked by its rich cultural mosaic. The city is home to a sizeable Hispanic and Latino population, contributing to its status as one of the most ethnically diverse cities in the United States. This demographic diversity extends to African Americans, Asians, and White residents, creating a dynamic blend of cultures, traditions, and languages.

            One notable aspect of Sacramento's demographic composition is its youthful population. The city is home to a significant number of young professionals, students, and families, drawn by its strong job market, educational institutions, and a relatively lower cost of living compared to other major California cities. This youthful energy has contributed to the city's vibrant arts and entertainment scene, making it a hub for creativity and innovation.
            
            As Sacramento's economy continues to grow and diversify, its demographic landscape also evolves. The city is becoming increasingly multicultural, and various ethnic enclaves and neighborhoods thrive, offering unique experiences and communities for residents and visitors alike. This dynamic mix of people, cultures, and backgrounds defines Sacramento's unique identity, making it a welcoming and inclusive place to live and explore.</p>

          <h2 class="discover-h1">Statistics</h2>
          <p class="discover-p">Sacramento, the capital of California, is a city with a rich tapestry of statistics that reflect its dynamic and diverse character. As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, Sacramento had a population of approximately 515,000 people, making it the sixth-largest city in California. The city's growth has been steady, driven by factors like its position as a hub for government, education, and healthcare in the region. Additionally, Sacramento is known for its cultural diversity, with various ethnicities and cultures contributing to its vibrant social landscape.

            Economically, Sacramento plays a significant role in California's economy. It has a diverse economic base, including government jobs, healthcare, education, agriculture, and a growing technology sector. In 2022, the median household income in Sacramento was around $60,000, though this number can vary significantly depending on the neighborhood and specific job opportunities. The city's cost of living is generally more affordable than other major California cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles, making it an attractive option for those seeking a high quality of life without the extreme costs associated with other urban centers in the state.</p>
